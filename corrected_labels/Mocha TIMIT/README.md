Preprocessing for the Mocha TIMIT dataset outlined in Section IV-B.

Samples characterized by low-quality laryngograph waveforms have been removed. 
The filenames of the qualifying samples are enumerated in filelist.lst.

As noted in our paper, we identified inaccuracies in some labels within the Mocha-TIMIT dataset. Folder "manually_corrected_subset" includes our manually corrected labels for specific utterances.
